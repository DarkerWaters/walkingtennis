				<h2>The Rules of Walking Tennis</h2>
				<p>Walking Tennis is a light adaptation of normal tennis. All the standard rules apply, but for a few specific changes:

					<span class="image right fit"><img src="images/pictures/lady-rear-walking.jpg" alt="playing tennis"/></span>
					<b>Option of a second bounce</b>
					<br/>In walking tennis you have the option of a second bounce.
					<br/>* The second bounce must land within the court lines.
					<br/>* The second bounce must land within the appropriate court markings (that is singles lines for singles, and doubles for doubles).
					<br/><br/><b>Running is not permitted</b>
					<br/>You are not allowed to break into a run.
					<br/>* Running is defined as both feet leaving the ground, even momentarily.
					<br/>* If you must, and want to, jump for a ball. You can, take care though, it hurts to land.
					<br/><br/><b>Orange tennis balls must be used</b>
					<br/>Walking tennis is played with a low-compression orange tennis ball.
					<br/>* This 'colour' isn't just the colour of the ball (most are actually still yellow). It refers to the amount of air inside the ball.
					<br/>* Walking tennis balls have less air pressed inside of them to make them bounce less and fly slower.

				<h2>The Walking Tennis ethos</h2>
				<p>Our goal is to make Walking Tennis as polite and fair as real tennis (if not more so). So let's play nice shall we?
				</p>
			</header>
			<div class="row">
				<h3>No aggressive behaviour</h2>
				<p>
					It might look fun on the TV, but in real-life, if the person at the other end of the court is shouting, smashing balls and racket, and being cross in general (even at themselves) it can be quite stressful.
					<br/>* So, if you are angry, take a breath, calm down. It's just tennis after all.
					<br/>* This includes swearing. You're probably outside; there are kids around, or just adults who might not like it. Let's keep it civil people.
				</p>
				<h3>Closest to the ball gets to call it</h2>
				<p>
					'In', 'Out', 'Long', 'Not up' - that's more than the allowed bounces. Whoever is closest is best positioned to decide.
					<br/>* The ball can move quickly, the net can hide it from you. The person on the other side is much closer and far better to judge. Just go with their opinion in an argument. You won't lose the match on a single decision (O;
					<br/>* There's always the option of <b>'close enough'</b>! Why stop the rally if you are enjoying it and can get it, play on! You can always claim the point at the end if you want.

				<h2>The Walking Tennis Complete Rules</h2>
				<p>
					Beyond the adjustments and the ethos, which mirrors the official rules of tennis, all the other rules from the International Tennis Federation, apply. 
					<br/>These can be quite hard to decipher, however. So we have included our own summary below.

				<b>A nice summary of the complete rules of tennis will be being written as soon as we can.</b>
